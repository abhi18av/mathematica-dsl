A Mathematica DSL in Scala
This is a simple internal domain-specific Mathematica like language for communicating with Mathematica

- Mathematica must be installed on the machine where you build and run this DSL,
  if you're using Maven, this install the JLink into your Maven repository:
mvn install:install-file -DgroupId=com.wolfram.jlink -DartifactId=JLink -Dversion=4.4 -Dpackaging=jar -Dfile=JLink.jar

- To run one of the samples without getting into native libraries configurations
  or errors, add the JLink.jar manually to your classpath. I am using IDEA so, 
  the samples should run once you configured the JLink path.

- A symbol template is provided under etc for IDEA
